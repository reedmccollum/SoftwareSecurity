# SoftwareSecurity

This project was my work on Artemis Financial's request to secure an application of theirs by creating self signed certificates for their software. I was able to accomplish this by generating keys for encryption with the SHA256 type. I then generated certificates for these keys to provide from server to users to be used for trusted connections. This project gave me a deep understanding of keystores and a better understanding of RESTful applications as well as Maven processes.
